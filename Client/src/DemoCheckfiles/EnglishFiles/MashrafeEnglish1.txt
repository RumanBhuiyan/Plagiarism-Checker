Mashrafe however informed that his wife, who has also contracted the virus, is yet to test negative.

"My wife however is still positive even after two weeks of contracting the virus. But she is doing fine. Seeking prayers for her," wrote Mashrafe. 

Mashrafe, who is the elected Member of Parliament from Narail-2, had tested positive for the virus on June 20 for the first time. After that, Mashrafe once again underwent the coronavirus test earlier this month but his results came out positive at that time.
